1. First copy the files "New_Alarm_Cond.c", and "errors.h" into your
   own directory.

2. To compile the program "alarm_cond.c", use the following command:

   cc alarm_cond.c -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS -lpthread

3. Type "a.out" to run the executable code.

4. At the prompt "ALARM>", type in the number of seconds at which
   the alarm should expire, followed by the text of the message.
   For example:

   ALARM> 2 Good Morning!

(To exit from the program, type Ctrl-d.)

5.. Read pages 82-88 of the book "Programming with POSIX Threads"
by David R. Butenhof for a detailed explanation of how the
program "alarm_cond.c" works.
(The book "Programming with POSIX Threads" has been put on
reserve in Steacie Library.)

## HOW TO RUN PROGRAM

1. Type `make` to compile

2. Type `./New_Alarm_Cond` to run the program
